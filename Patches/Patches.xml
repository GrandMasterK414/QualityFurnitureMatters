  <!--
    NOTE: We avoid changing EndTable.maxSimultaneous here to maximize compatibility
    with other mods. The StatPart caps contributions to 2 end tables / 1 dresser
    (up to 3 total) without altering placement rules. If you want placement to
    allow two end tables per bed, change the original game defs or keep a small
    optional patch in a fork.

  <!-- Add BedRestEffectiveness stat to EndTable so it shows in furniture stats (base: 1%) -->
  <!-- NOTE: EndTable and Dresser do not receive a BedRestEffectiveness stat anymore.
       The StatPart calculates bonuses at runtime from furniture quality so furniture
       themselves do not expose this stat (improves vanilla compatibility).
  -->

  <!-- 
    Dresser already has maxSimultaneous=1, which is correct.
    No patch needed for dresser count.
  -->
