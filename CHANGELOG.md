# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.1.2] - 2025-12-08
- Balance/behavior: bonuses are now derived directly from furniture quality (runtime-based). Furniture no longer expose a `BedRestEffectiveness` stat.
- Conservative default caps: max 1 dresser, max 1 end table, max 2 total per bed.
- Default quality mapping (per-item additive): Awful -1%, Poor -0.5%, Normal 0%, Good +0.5%, Excellent +1%, Masterwork +2%, Legendary +4%.
- Added in-game settings (toggles, per-bed caps, global multiplier) and improved tooltip breakdown.
- Packaging: runtime-only release (DLL + defs/patches); source moved to a private backup to control publishing.

## [v0.1.1] - 2025-12-08
- Initial runtime release with settings and a first upload to GitHub Releases. Public repo later adjusted to keep source private.

## [v0.1.0] - (development)
- Prototype implementation and initial design notes.
